==APAC Destinasia Travel Rules Demo==

This demo is to install JBoss BRMS with Destinasia Travel discount rules in the Cloud based on leveraging any Red Hat OpenShift container based platform, such as:

 - [Red Hat Container Platform (OCP)](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)
  
It delivers a fully functioning containerized JBoss BRMS installation.


Install JBoss BRMS on OpenShift
-------------------------------
1. First ensure you have an OpenShift container based installation, such as one of the following installed first:

  - [OCP Install Demo](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)

  - or your own OpenShift installation.

2. [Download and unzip this demo.](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/apac-destinasia-rules-demo/archive/master.zip)

3. Add products to installs directory.

4. Run 'init.sh' or 'init.bat' file. 'init.bat' must be run with Administrative privileges:
```
   # The installation needs to be pointed to a running version
   # of OpenShift, so pass an IP address such as:
   #
   $ ./init.sh 192.168.99.100  # example for OCP.
```

Now log in to JBoss BRMS and start developing containerized rules projects (the address will be generated by the init script).

  - OCP example: [http://apac-destinasia-rules-demo.192.168.99.100.xip.io/business-central](http://apac-destinasia-rules-demo.10.1.2.2.xip.io/business-central) ( u:erics / p:jbossbrms1! )


Notes
-----
This project can be installed on any OpenShift platform, such as OpenShift Container Platform or Red Hat Container Development Kit. It's possible to install it on any available installation by pointing this installer to an OpenShift IP address:
```
  $ ./init.sh IP
```

If for any reason the installation breaks or you want a new JBoss BRMS installation, just remove the project apac-destinasia-rules-demo entry in the OpenShift console and re-run the installation.

Should your local network DNS not handle the resolution of the above address, giving you page not found errors, you can apply the following to your local hosts file:

```
$ sudo vi /etc/hosts

# add host for OCP demo resulution
192.168.99.100   apac-destinasia-rules-demo.192.168.99.100.xip.io 
```
